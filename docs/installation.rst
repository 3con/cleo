Installation
------------

You can install Cleo in 2 different ways:

* The easier and more straightforward is to use pip

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install cleo

* Use the official repository (https://github.com/SDisPater/cleo)

.. note::

    Cleo has not been tested on Windows for now so it's likely not going
    to work properly.
    Windows support will be added in future versions.
